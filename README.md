# hackerrank

I am participating in HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com/) 30 days of coding.

Day 2 - Calculate percentages and used num.toFixed() to get decimal places.
Day 3 - Logic (if else statements)
Day 4 - jumpingTheClouds - using arrays
Day 5 - recoverSecretFromTriplets (codewars) - practice using splice to remove items from array, place items in array; practice using indexOf to find items in array
BubbleSort - In ES6, you can swap array elements as follows: [a[j], a[j+1]] = [a[j+1], a[j]]
repeatedString - Used index to get each character in a string for comparison against another character.
TicTacToe - using comparisons and 2D arrays
Snail (Codewars) - recursion to navigate through a multi-dimensional array. used array commands push and splice.
